                <p class=" mt-4">Reverse logistics start at the end consumer, moving backward through the supply chain to the distributor or from the distributor to the manufacturer. Reverse logistics can also include processes where the end consumer is responsible for the final disposal of the product, including recycling, refurbishing, or resale.</p>
                <p class=" mt-4">Globally, companies are changing the ways they address waste, and the supply chain is a big piece of that initiative. These reverse logistics examples focus on returns, exchanges and recycling.</p>
